# Data Structures
Data structures might not be the sexiest topic but they're a crucial part of programming in general and have some deep insights into Python's language design.

Lists, tuples, and sets all store collections of objects and dictionaries store mappings (with key-value pairs).

## Lists
We've already seen lists in Python! They are finite, ordered, mutable, collections of elements.

* Finite â€“ lists have a non-infinite size.
* Ordered â€“Â every element in a list has an index and the elements have an order (there is a first element, second element, third element, etc.).
* Mutable â€“Â after a list is created, you can modify it.

Lists are delimited with square brackets (`[]`) and commas separate elements. So, `simple_as = ['do', 're', 'mi']` defines a list that contains three elements.

Lists can contain any type of object. One list can also have elements of different types. For example,

```python
mixed = [4, 5, 'seconds']
inception = [['a', 'dream'], ['within', 'a'], 'dream']
```

As we mentioned in [Python Basics](1-python-basics.md), list indexing and slicing behaves similarly to strings. 

To get the number of elements in a list, use the `len` function. For example,

```python
len(inception) # => 3
```

You can also check if an element is in a list with the `in` keyword. For example,

```python
'within' in inception        # => False
['within', 'a'] in inception # => True
```

You can convert other collections into lists using the `list` function. For example, a string is a collection of characters; we can produce a list of characters from a string like so:

```python
list("unicorn") # => ['u', 'n', 'i', 'c', 'o', 'r', 'n']
```

Next, we'll cover some operations that you can perform on lists which are divided into three categories â€“Â those that are very important to know, those that are good to know, and those that are less important.

| Very Important | Good to Know | Less Important |
| -------------- | ------------ | -------------- |
| `.append`      | `.extend`    | `.reverse`     |
| `.sort`        | `.count`     | `.insert`      |
| `.remove`      |              |                |

### Very Important
`.append` allows you to add an element to the end of a list. For example,

```python
numbers = [2, 3, 5, 5]

numbers.append(4)
numbers # => [2, 3, 5, 5, 4]
```

`.sort` allows you to sort a list in place (the function returns `None`, but the value of the list will change). Continuing the previous example,

```python
numbers.sort()
numbers # => [2, 3, 4, 5, 5]
```

Finally, `.remove` allows you to remove the first instance of an element by value. For example,

```python
numbers.remove(5)
numbers # => [2, 3, 4, 5]
```

If you try to remove an element that doesn't exist in the list, the program will raise a `ValueError`.

### Good to Know
If you want to append a series of numbers that are stored in another list (more precisely, any ordered collection), you can use the `.extend` function. For example,

```python
letters = ['u', 'n', 'i', 'c', 'o', 'r', 'n']

numbers.extend(letters)
numbers # => [2, 3, 4, 5, 'u', 'n', 'i', 'c', 'o', 'r', 'n']
```

The `.count` function returns the number of occurrences of an element in a list. For example,

```python
letters.count('n')             # => 2
letters.count(['u', 'n', 'i']) # => 0
```

### Less Important
The `.reverse` function will reverse the order of a list in place (the function will return `None` but the value of the list will change). For example,

```python
letters.reverse()
letters # => ['n', 'r', 'o', 'c', 'i', 'n', 'u']
```

Finally, the `.insert` function will add an element into a list at a location other than the end of the list. You provide two arguments to the `.insert` function: an index and the element to insert. For example,

```python
letters.insert(1, True)
letters # => ['n', True, 'r', 'o', 'c', 'i', 'n', 'u']
```

## Tuples
Tuples are virtually identical to lists except for the fact that tuples are immutable. This means that after a tuple is created, it cannot be modified.

This feature has a plethora of benefits. For one, Python has decided that because of this, tuples can be hashable which allows them to serve as keys in a dictionary. More broadly, tuples should be used to represent data which has a fixed number of entries.

A tuple is declared with parenthesis and commas separating elements. **Warning**: To create a tuple with one element, you have to add a comma after the element. For example,

```python
t = (4)
type(t) # => int

t = (4,)
type(t) # => tuple
```

One good use of tuples is to represent an addresses. For example,

```python
sherlock = ('221B Baker St', 'London', 'UK')
```

In the above representation, we've decided that an address will be represented by `(street, city, country)`. It doesn't make sense to "append" or "delete" an element from an address so it's better to use a tuple rather than a list.

If you try to edit an element of a tuple, Python will raise a `TypeError`. For example,

```python
sherlock[0] = '221C Barker Ln' # TypeError
```

But you can use the `len` function, the `in` keyword, and slicing/indexing just like lists. For example,

```python
len(sherlock)    # => 3
'UK' in sherlock # => True
sherlock[::-1]   # => ('UK', 'London', '221B Baker St')
```

### Tuple Packing
Tuple packing and unpacking are two of the most innocuous-looking but powerful features of Python.

If you type a series of objects separated by commas, Python will automatically bundle them together into a tuple. This is called tuple packing. For example,

```python
christopher_robin = 'Pooh', 'Tigger', 'Piglet'
print(christopher_robin) # ('Pooh', 'Tigger', 'Piglet')
type(christopher_robin)  # tuple
```

If you type a series of variable names and set them equal to a tuple, Python will assign values to the variables element by element. This is called tuple unpacking. For example,

```python
x, y, z = christopher_robin

x # => 'Pooh'
y # => 'Tigger'
z # => 'Piglet'
```

These two can be used in tandem if you'd like to assign values to multiple variables at the same time. For example,

```python
first, last, age = 'Unicornelius', None, 1001
```

You can also swap the values of two variables really succinctly:

```python
first, last = last, first

first # => None
last  # => 'Unicornelius'
```

For example, we can use tuple unpacking to succinctly compute the fibonacci series:

```python
def fibbi(n):
    """
    Print out the first n Fibonacci numbers
    """
    a, b = 0, 1
    
    for i in range(n):
        print(a)
        a, b = b, a + b
```

### Immutable References
One quirk of tuples is that you can put a mutable object into a tuple! For example,

```python
org = ("Dumbledore's Army", ['harry', 'hermione', 'ron'])
```

Tuples contain immutable references to underlying objects, even if those objects are mutable. For example, we could do:

```python
org[1].append('cho')

org # => ("Dumbledore's Army", ['harry', 'hermione', 'ron', 'cho'])
```

But, it's invalid to replace the list entirely:

```python
org[1] = ['draco', 'goyle'] # TypeError
```
